                <p style="text-indent: 40px">My mother used to read a lot and she always wanted me and my brother to read a lot as well, to keep the brain juices flowing. It didin't work that well with my brother, but it stuck with me and now I read everyday just before bed.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">I still share some reading moments with my mother, explaining her the book i'm reading, or asking for suggestions or opinions on certain books.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">The last book I read was <b>The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak</b>, and it was a blast. I's a book narrated byt <b>Death</b>, set in the timescale of the Second World War, about a little girl that's taken away from her mother to german foster parents. The book in itself is about her keen ability to steal books and enchant everyone with her words, which she learnt from her foster parent. It's a brilliant book and I already miss reading it every night.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Right now, i'm reading <b>O Ãšltimo Olhar, by Miguel Sousa Tavares</b>, a book written by a famous Portuguese writer. I don't really know much about it, but it's a narration on Covid-19 times so I thought it would be interesting.</p>
