                <p style="text-indent: 40px">I got into photography when my mom and my brother bought me a Nikon D3400 for my birthday. It was such a huge present and I couldn't let go of my camera for a good few weeks! I learn't a lot on youtube and, even though i'm still and amateur, I managed to take those pictures that are cycling above this text.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Even though I really like taking pictures, I don't really like editing them. I find the process a tad boring and it takes away a bit of the realness that the photos have. That's why I edit really basic things and try to make them look as natural as I can.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Those photos above include my cat <b>Björk</b>, some plants and a project I did with my brother. He painted this cartoony Dwarf named <b>Serra da Arrábida</b>, which means Arrábida Mountain Range, a paradisic place here in Portugal, and we went about our life putting him in cool or funny spots, making him come to life. It was pretty fun and I hope we <q>collab</q> like this more often!</p>
