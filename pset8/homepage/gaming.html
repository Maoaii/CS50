                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Got into gaming at a really young age because of my brother. He used to play on his desktop or his Playstations and I used to sit beside him playing on Gameboy's or Nintendo's.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Needless to say that my passion for gaming has come a long way. Played through mobile consoles, Playstations, computer games, mobile games, card games and even tabletop games. No other hobby has given me as much joy and good memories and playing with my brother!</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Currently i'm playing <b>Oxygen Not Included</b> and it's been a blast. Just made it through cycle 50 and you can't even imagine how hyped I am. For those of you who don't know, ONI is a survival-colony-management game where you order these little fellas, the dupes, on an asteroid, that you landed on in an emergency. You fight for oxygen and to maintain food resources high and the gist of the game is to manage gases on you base - oxygen, carbon-dyoxide, helium, hydrogen, and some more. It's a tad complex with all the automation, but it's a pretty cool game all around.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">But, by far, my favourite game so far has to be <b>Hollow Knight</b>. I won't get into much detail, but it's a Metroidvania game with some pretty challenging fights. It's a 10/10 and there isn't even one reason not to play it.</p>
