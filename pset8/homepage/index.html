                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Hello! I'm Lucas and I built this website so you could learn a bit about me!</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">I was born in 2002 and i'm currently a Computer Science freshman in Portugal. I started CS50 in 2020 but hit a <q>coder's block</q> when I got to the Speller check problem set. I thought it was too hard and basically gave up on the course and took a different route, doing some C# and Unity courses to start coding games.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">A year later, I got back to CS50 and was determined to end it. Did all the problem sets from the beginning, including the labs that weren't around the past year and got past my last checkpoint. Being able to code much better than before, I decided to switch my academic career and went from a Dentistry college to Computer Science one.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Now, here I am, coding my first webpage! It was a fun ride and I hope that i'll just keep getting better and better.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">Up top, on the header, are my main hobbies and a bit of context regarding each one. Feel free to jump around a get to know me a bit better! Thank you for reading!</p>
